            Why Visit an Emergency Dentist?
          </h3>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Most often people ignore dental issues until they develop into
            something far more complex to treat. If you are not sure whether the
            pain you have is a dental emergency a dentist can confirm with a
            quick diagnosis. This improves your chances of saving a potentially
            damaged tooth or crown before it is too late.
